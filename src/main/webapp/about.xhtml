                    <p>I'm a 21 year old student living in the UK. I'm currently studying Computing at the University of Portsmouth.</p>
                    <p>I have always had a massive interest in software and technology and knew it was something I wanted to pursue from a young age.</p>
                    <p>I began learning HTML and CSS while I was 16 and still in school. I then started to learn about JavaScript which prompted me to get into programming</p>
                    <p>I started learning PHP from online resources and a book i borrowed from school.</p>
                    <p>While I was in collage I borrowed the book "Heads First Java" by O'Reilly Media and quickly progressed my skills and knowledge.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my studies I have started loads of personal projects which have forced me to learn and develop my skills.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p>In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, playing video games and socialising.
