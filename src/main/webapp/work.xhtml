            <hr/>
            <p>Since the age of 16 I have been creating simple websites and wordpress sites for small amounts of money.</p>
            <p>While I was 17 and in collage I was offered to create a website for a small local music festival which is hosted yearly.
            I was the developer while another student was the designer. It involved a heavy amount of javascript and this prompted me to learn JQuery.
            This website is unluckily not online anymore though.</p>
            <p>I have worked in retail in McDonalds on the cashier and also as an assistant manager for an electronic cigarette retailer.</p>
            <p>I have also worked as an assistant labourer working with family friends and also for a quad bike business.</p>
